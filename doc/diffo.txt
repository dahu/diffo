Help on using diffo                                                    *diffo*

Diffo extends the builtin |DiffOrig| functionality by allowing you to close the
diff buffer from either window.

User-configurable maps are provided to start and stop and update DiffOrig:
* <plug>diffo_open   mapped to <leader>do by default
* <plug>diffo_close  mapped to <leader>dc by default
* <plug>diffo_close  mapped to <leader>du by default

To override these, provide maps like this in your |$MYVIMRC|:
>
  nmap <leader>x <plug>diffo_open
  nmap <leader>y <plug>diffo_close
  nmap <leader>z <plug>diffo_update
<

The :DiffOrig command is a toggle, opening a diff session in a normal window and
closing one in a DiffOrig window.

NOTE: For :DiffOrig to close the DiffOrig window, your cursor needs to
be in that window first. You can identify it by its buffer name as
[Scratch].
