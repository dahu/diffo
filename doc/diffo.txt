Diffo extends the builtin |DiffOrig| functionality by allowing you to close the
diff buffer from either window.

Two user-configurable maps are provided to start and stop DiffOrig:
* <plug>diffo-open   mapped to <leader>do by default
* <plug>diffo-close  mapped to <leader>dc by default

To override these, provide maps like this in your |$MYVIMRC|:
>
  nmap <leader>x <plug>diffo_open
  nmap <leader>X <plug>diffo_close
<

The :DiffOrig command is a toggle, opening a diff session in a normal window and
closing one in a DiffOrig window.
