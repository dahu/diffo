== Diffo

__DiffOrig__

=== Usage

Diffo extends the builtin +DiffOrig+ functionality by allowing you to
close the diff buffer from either window.

.User-configurable maps are provided to start and stop and update DiffOrig:

* +<plug>diffo_open+   mapped to +<leader>do+ by default
* +<plug>diffo_close+  mapped to +<leader>dc+ by default
* +<plug>diffo_close+  mapped to +<leader>du+ by default

.To override these, provide maps like this in your |$MYVIMRC|:

  nmap <leader>x <plug>diffo_open
  nmap <leader>y <plug>diffo_close
  nmap <leader>z <plug>diffo_update

The +:DiffOrig+ command is a toggle, opening a diff session in a normal
window and closing one in a DiffOrig window.
